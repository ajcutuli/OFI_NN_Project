    "## Opening Remarks\n",
    "The enigma concerning the predictability of markets has always been the principal driver of my interest in finance, and it inpires my ongoing exploration of machine learning's applications within the analysis and forecasting of financial time series. Today, we compare the performance of a studied deep learning model for limit order book forecasting on two stationary representations of the limit order book."

    "## Abstract\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement an artificial neural network originally employed by Zhang et al[<sub>[1]</sub>](#ref1) that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network in order to classify future directions of an order book at a high frequency. Specifically, given Coinbase order book data for Bitcoin, we seek to predict whether the mid price increases, decreases, or does not change in the next observation of the time series. Unlike Zhang et al's papers we reference[<sub>[1]</sub>](#ref1)[<sub>[2]</sub>](#ref2), which use non-stationary order book states as inputs to the network, our instantiation of the architecture is trained on order flow and order flow imbalance, which are stationary quantities derived from the limit order book[<sub>[3]</sub>](#ref3). Hence, this discussion also draws heavy inspiration from a 2021 article by Kolm et al[<sub>[4]</sub>](#ref4), which demonstrated that forecasting using order flow significantly outperforms raw order book inputs. Today, we further this discussion by doing an analysis of the impact that differencing order flow into order flow imbalance has on the forecasting performance of the model. We also approach the problem from a time series modeling perspective by analyzing the time-lag of the processes, a procedure that was not explicitly documented in those papers. We find that for our sparse data, the models are similarly poor in their ability to predict downward moves, but the model trained on order flow significantly outperforms the other when it comes to predicting upward moves. In the trading scenario we posit, we see that this failure to precisely predict downward moves is troublesome for intraday trading in a bearish market."

    "## Order Books, Flow, and Imbalance\n",
    "Today's trading of equities and other securities is often facilitated by a [*limit order book*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book), also known as an *order book*. The order book collects bids and offers made by prospective buyers and sellers and determines which incoming orders get executed and which are added to the book. The *bid price* is the highest price buyers are prepared to buy at, and the *ask price* is the lowest price sellers are willing to sell at. The *mid price*, which our model seeks to predict moves in, is the midpoint of the bid price and the ask price.\n",
    "\n",
    "An order is defined by its side, quantity demanded, price to trade at, and time of submission. As one enters the system, the matching engine of the exchange tries to match the order with existing orders in the book. Orders that match are executed and called *market orders*, and orders that do not match or only partially match are added to the book and called *limit orders*.\n",

    "Our model takes as inputs representations of the first ten levels of the order book. A level is denoted by its price and volume that is bid or asked. So, as we progress down levels on the bid side of the order book, the price decreases, and as we progress down levels of the ask side, the price increases. Each observation in our dataset will be a 40-variable vector displaying the price and volume for each of the top ten bid and ask levels, giving us a truncated screenshot of the *state of the limit order book* at each timestep. \n",

    "While a sequence of limit order book states is a complex non-stationary process, the above formulas for order flow and order flow imbalance transform consecutive order book states into a [stationary process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process). This property allows for our eventual test test of the deep learning model to be reasonably similar to the training set and thus appropriate to predict off of using the model. It also allows for more ease in the learning of long-term dependencies by our LSTM layer, which Kolm et al see as a reason behind their finding that sequence length only marginally impacted model performance[<sub>[4]</sub>](#ref4). On a separate note, when trained on order flow, which keeps the bid and ask sides separate, the CNN layers of our model will be given the added flexibility of being able to combine bid and ask order flows asymmetrically, so we hypothesize that our forecasting model will perform better on order flow than on order flow imbalance. This theory is expressed by Kolm et al[<sub>[4]</sub>](#ref4) and shared by time series analysis theory[<sub>[5]</sub>](#ref5)."

    "## Introducing the CNN-LSTM Model\n",
    "While the [universal approximation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) states that a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer can approximate any continuous function on any compact set, different neural network architectures are capable of exploiting unique structures in data, which is a quality particularly useful for the learning of complex financial time series. These different architectures, which include CNNs and LSTMs among others, can compress data and change their behavior over time in a way that supports their efficacy in difficult modeling situations. On the other hand, simple feedforward neural networks can suffer from instability and less interpretability when seeking to learn complex relationships in data[<sub>[6]</sub>](#ref6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although artificial neural networks can be used individually, they are often complementary in their modeling capabilities and, when used together, can learn unique structures in data and improve a model's ability to execute a desired task. For instance, our CNN-LSTM model architecture we adopt consists of CNN layers and an Inception Module that compress and wrap the order book data in a manner that allows a LSTM module to learn temporal dependencies from a smaller parameter space, leading to a more parsimonious model[<sub>[1]</sub>](#ref1).\n",
    "\n",
    "[*Convolutional neural networks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNNs) are feedforward neural networks that can exploit data locality in an input, so in the CNN-LSTM model, CNN layers reduce the dimension of the multivariate input by aggregating bid and ask sides and levels in the order book. The output of these convolutional layers serve as an input to the [*Inception Module*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842v1.pdf), which wraps convolutions together to capture behavior over multiple timescales, acting as a sort of moving average indicator whose decay weights are learned via [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)[<sub>[1]</sub>](#ref1). Then, the outputs of the Inception Module are concatenated and reshaped into an input to the [*long short-term memory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) (LSTM) layer. LSTMs are a class of [*recurrent neural networks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNNs) that are designed to handle temporal dependencies in sequential data and alleviate the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem) faced by generic RNNs[<sub>[7]</sub>](#ref7).

That is, with [*Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/ml-quantifying-uncertainty/mc-dropout.html), we can add [epistemic uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification#Aleatoric_and_epistemic)[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1) to our neural network architecture by making multiple out-of-sample predictions and dropping a different random sample of neurons with every forward pass. This random sampling leads to different predictions on each evaluation iteration, so we can average the results to––in theory––improve out-of-sample predictions. The dropout layer is inserted after the Inception Module, and we determine its rate with [cross-validated grid-search](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html).\n",

    "Lastly, since we formulate this forecasting problem as one of classification, we add an output layer with a [softmax activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function), resulting in a final output whose elements represent the probability of observing each price movement in the next timestamp. We train the models by minimizing [categorical cross-entropy loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy#Cross-entropy_loss_function_and_logistic_regression) with [stochastic gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) using the [Adam optimization algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf), whose parameters we set to those of the DeepLOB implementation of the model[<sub>[1]</sub>](#ref1).\n",

    "### Vector Autoregressive Processes\n",
    "[*Vector autoregression*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression) (VAR) is the multivariate extension of [*autoregression*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model). That is, a VAR model is a statistical representation of a collection of time-varying [stochastic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) that is prominent in the modeling of multivariate financial time series and other complex randomly-evolving processes. The term *autoregressive* indicates that each realization of the process is a linear function of previous values in the sequence plus a stochastic error term that is uncorrelated with those of other periods. That is, for a $ K $-variate time series $ \\left\\{y_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^{t-1} $ in which we assume only $ p $ past values are necessary to forecast the next observation $ y_{t} $, we have the VAR$(p)$ representation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_{t}= c + A_1 y_t + A_2 y_{t-1} + ... + A_p y_{t-p} + u_{t}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ c = (c_1, ..., c_K)' $, $ A_i =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\alpha_{11,i} & \\dots & \\alpha_{1K,i} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "\\alpha_{K1,i} & \\dots & \\alpha_{KK,i} \\end{bmatrix} $, and $ \\left\\{u_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^{t} = \\left\\{(u_{1i}, ..., u_{Ki})' \\right\\}_{i=1}^{t} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^K$ is independently identically distributed with mean zero. We do not assume that all $ A_i $ are nonzero, so $p$ really represents an upper bound on the order of the process[<sub>[5]</sub>](#ref5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in order to be confident that our lag parameters generalize well to out-of-sample predictions, we want to assert that the VAR$(p)$ processes are *stable*. That is, we want to check that they fluctuate about constant means and their variances do not change with respect to time. If this condition holds, then the processes are stationary[<sub>[5]</sub>](#ref5)."

    "### Stationarity and Cointegration\n",
    "A time series is considered weakly [*stationary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process) if its mean and correlation coefficients remain constant as time progresses. That is, a stationary time series is one that changes over time in a manner that is consistent. This is important because when a model is learned, what the model is really learning are the regression coefficients. So, when a model predicts on data in the time series, it is doing so using its knowledge of the relationship that was learned in previous data points. Because of this, we want to ensure that that relationship remains consistent in unseen future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an interesting and relevant aside on the topic of stationarity, we introduce the related concepts of integration and cointegration. A time series $x_t$ is [*integrated*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_integration) of order $d$ if $(1-L)^dx_t$ is stationary, where $(1-L)x_t=x_t-x_{t-1}$. And for a collection of individually integrated time series, if a stationary linear combination of them exists, then the combined (multivariate) time series is said to be [*cointegrated*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointegration). We consider a multivariate time series to be stationary if the number of cointegrated relationships is equal to the number of variables in the time series[<sub>[9]</sub>](#ref9).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this understanding of cointegration, it's easy to conclude that our multivariate time series for order flow and order flow imbalance are stationary; since we know order flow and order flow imbalance to be univariately stationary[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2), they are univariately integrated of order 0 and thus a stationary linear combination can be constructed from any collection of variables in their respective time series. Moreover, for a VAR model to be a feasible representation of a time series, all variables must be of the same order of integration, so currently we feel pretty confident thinking that a VAR model is a good way to represent the data.  Now, while stability in a VAR$(p)$ process implies stationarity of the process, the converse is not always true[<sub>[5]</sub>](#ref5), so although we accept our time series to be stationary, we still should assert that the VAR processes are stable in order to make appropriate use of their VAR orders.\n",

As advocated for in BDLOB[<sub>[2]</sub>](#ref2), we employ variational dropout as a stochastic regularizer in the deep neural network and exhaustively compare scoring over several different dropout rates. We apply [early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping) to avoid overfitting by terminating training when validation loss has not improved for 5 consecutive epochs[<sub>[4]</sub>](#ref4).\n",

    "As in any forecasting problem, our solution at each timestamp is the [conditional expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_expectation) of the data given the model's parameters. So, to account for uncertainty in our model parameters, we use MC dropout to better approximate the conditional expectations at each out-of-sample observation by performing 100 forward passes on each model and storing the average. That is, as the number of out-of-sample predictions we execute grows very large, the average across those predictions will approach the true conditional probability of an outcome given the training data. We also want to store a vector of these predictions from each pass, as that information will be useful for model comparison and in constructing a trading strategy that utilizes uncertainty."

    "The confusion matrices reinforce the fact that the order flow model makes better predictions. This is particularly the case when it comes to upward moves; the order flow model is more illiberal with its upward predictions, but the predictions it does make are clearly more in line with the true moves. On the other hand, both models are not good at predicting downward moves. This will likely be problematic in our trading scenario, since the Bitcoin mid price dropped by 1% over the course of the trading period we consider."

    "Now, how can we use uncertainty information to inform trading decisions? This strategy borrows BDLOB's use of *predictive [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory))* to summarize classification uncertainty due to variational dropout[<sub>[2]</sub>](#ref2). The metric of predictive entropy $\\mathbb{H}$ follows from our aforementioned understanding of conditional expectation by making use of the predictive distribution captured by our 100 forward passes from earlier. For an input $x_t$, a predicted output $y_t$, training data $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{train}}$, and estimated model parameters $\\hat{w}$, we define predictive entropy by\n",

    "Essentially, $j$ iterates over each class and summarizes the average level of uncertainty for outcomes of that class. The function is minimized when the model is certain––when one class has probability 1 and all others are 0. The function is maximized when the model is very uncertain––probability is uniform across the classes. Also observe that our earlier notation $\\hat{p}_{j,t}$ is shorthand for $\\frac{1}{100}\\sum_{k=1}^{100} p(y_{t}=j|x_{t},\\hat{w})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this metric, we upsize our positions if our model is certain and downsize our positions if the model is uncertain. More specifically, we still go long or short if $\\hat{p}_{1,t}>\\alpha$ or $\\hat{p}_{-1,t}>\\alpha$, respectively, but we upsize our positions to $1.5 \\times \\mu$ if $\\tilde{\\mathbb{H}}_t<\\beta_1$, keep our size $\\mu$ if $\\beta_1< \\tilde{\\mathbb{H}}_t < \\beta_2$, downsize to $0.5 \\times \\mu$ if $\\tilde{\\mathbb{H}}_t>\\beta_2$, and exit the current position if $\\tilde{\\mathbb{H}}_t < \\beta_2$[<sub>[2]</sub>](#ref2).

    "Unfortunately, the models were both very poor in their ability to generate profits, but this should come as no surprise. Recall that our models predict downward moves almost identically poorly, so it is reasonable to believe that the model is doomed to behave poorly in a downward trending regime. And since the Bitcoin mid price dropped 1% over the duration of the trading period, our understanding of the model justify the results we see. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the losses are very disappointing, there are still valuable observations that can be made. Firstly, we see in the plot of cumulative profits that the returns––or lack of returns––from the Bayesian trading strategy are mostly steady about 0, while the softmax strategy returns are more erratic.

If true, there is statistical evidence that the model is underfitting, and we should increase the lag parameter of our sequential model and re-train. If false, we accept the model residuals to be [white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise). \n",

    "Unfortunately, we conclude that both models are underfitting the training data, so we should increase the lag parameter and redo the training and diagnostics until we no longer underfit. However, we don't pursue this route for a few reasons. For one, while increasing the lag does not lead to any risk of overfitting the deep learning model, doing so increases computational time[<sup>5</sup>](#fn5). With the current lag, iterating through the cross-validation and training takes many many hours already, and I'm antsy to finish this project. Secondly, Kolm et al[<sub>[4]</sub>](#ref4) found that different choices for the lag parameter had little impact on the performance of the CNN-LSTM model for their regression problem. And as a third point, the fact that the model is underfitting should come as no surprise, since this really tells us that our model is too simple for the data. Financial data, even such stationary processes as order flow and order flow imbalance, are incredibly complex, so it's hard to expect any interpretable model to well-fit the input data. In this truth lies one of the problems of deep learning in finance.\n",

    "## Shortfalls of Deep Learning\n",
    "Machine learning models are able to identify patterns in data even where there are none. In finance, where anomalous features in datasets can be frequent, this underlying mechanism can lead to misidentified strategies and be very costly if the model implementation, validation, and utilization is not approached with caution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, markets are always changing, and static models such as our CNN-LSTM are trained on a security's characteristics during one market state. Hence, the sustainability of such a model in out-of-time samples is a concern, and constant fine-tuning can be expensive and represent a suboptimal allocation of resources for a trader.\n",

    "Nonetheless, I find the topic really cool and believe it to be a valuable use of my study time."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we implemented a well-studied and popular deep learning model with the intent of forecasting the mid price of the limit order book and comparing model performance on a pair of related stationary inputs. We found that when trained on a sparse amount of data, the models predicted downward moves in the target mid price awfully, which led to losing trading attempts in two strategies. The analysis was not all for naught, however: the order flow model outperformed the order flow imbalance model in upward moves, and utilizing uncertainty information in a trading strategy led to less erratic cumulative profits on average. I also believe that showcasing the models' lack of success in a bearish market was a valuable informal stress test for the model.\n",
